# Get the right hwmon path to monitor CPU temp in polybar.
# Specifically we are looking for the hardware monitor with name `k10temp` which is the driver that
# can read AMD CPU temps.
# Once we have matched on this `k10temp` name, we are looking for the right temperature among:
#  - Tdie -> the die temperature, that is the real measured temp
#  - Tctl -> the temperature control value, which is the reported temp
#  - Tccd{1..8} ->  the temperature of of the core complex dies.
# Tdie is most likely what we want since it's the most accurate and Tctl can be somewhat different
# since it is not necessarily the real measured temp and is instead used for fan control.
# See https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.12/hwmon/k10temp.html
