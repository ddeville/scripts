! Turn CapsLock into Control, Control into Super_L and Control_L as Super_L
! This is because:
!   1. I have always used CapsLock as Control on the command line
!   2. I have used macs forever and have that Command key wired in my fingers
!   3. We need a key to act as Super mod for the window manager (Control_L here)

clear lock
clear control
clear mod4

! Set Left Control to Left Super
keycode 37 = Super_L
! Set Caps Lock to Left Control
keycode 66 = Control_L
! Set Left Super to Left Control
keycode 133 = Control_L

add control = Control_L Control_R
add mod4 = Super_L Super_R
