Scripts
=======

A bunch of scripts I use on every machine I set up. A lot of inspiration was taken from a [post](http://furbo.org/2014/09/03/the-terminal/) by Craig Hockenberry.

When setting up a new machine, do the following steps:

* Clone this repo in the Home directory:
```
> cd ~
> git clone git@github.com:ddeville/Scripts.git
```

* Link the .dotfiles
```
> ln -s ~/Scripts/.profile .profile
> ln -s ~/Scripts/.lldbinit .lldbinit
> ln -s ~/Scripts/.gitconfig .gitconfig
> ln -s ~/Scripts/.vimrc .vimrc
```
